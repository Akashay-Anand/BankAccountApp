Project: Bank Application
Scenario: You are a back-end developer and need to create an application to handle new customer bank account requests.

Your application should do the following:
* Read a .csv file of names, CIF numbers, account type, and initial deposit.
* Use a proper data structure to hold all these accounts
* Both savings and current accounts share the following properties:
	deposit(), withdraw(), tranfer(), showinfo()

11-Digit Account Number (generated with the following process: 1 or 2 dependong on Savings or Current, last two digits of CIF, unique 5-digit number, and random 3-digit number)


* Savings Account holders are given a Safety Deposit Box, identified by a 3-digit number and accessed with a 4-digit code.
* Current Account holders are assigned a Debit Card with a 12-digit number and 4-digit PIN.
* Both accounts will use an interfacce that determines the base interest rate. 
 >	Savings accounts will use .25 points less than the base rate.
 >	Current accounts will use 15% of the base rate
* The Showinfo method should reveal relevent account information as well as information specific to the Current account or Saving account.


Learning objectives:
* Learn to develop a robust application architecture
* Use when to use abstract class and abstract methods
* Use an interface API to recive information from a developer's application
* Explore constructors deeper and use public, private, or protected
* Read data from a file and store in an appropriate data structure
* Generate random numbers and work with String API.
